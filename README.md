Autonomous GitHub Push Script (push_to_github.sh)A fully autonomous bash script that prepares your local project and pushes it to a new or existing GitHub repository. This tool is designed to be a fire-and-forget solution for initializing a project on GitHub, handling everything from dependency checks to the final push.It simplifies the repetitive process of setting up a new repository, making it perfect for developers who want to get their code on GitHub quickly and without manual steps.‚ú® FeaturesFully Autonomous: Requires zero manual configuration outside of running the script.Dependency Checks: Automatically verifies if git and the GitHub CLI (gh) are installed.Auto-Installation: If the GitHub CLI (gh) is not found, it attempts to install it using the system's package manager (supports macOS via Homebrew, and Debian/Ubuntu/Fedora/CentOS on Linux).Authentication Handling: Checks if you're logged into GitHub and prompts you to log in if you aren't.Git Identity Setup: If your local Git user.name and user.email are not configured, it will ask for them and set them for the current repository.Smart Repository Handling:Creates a new public repository on your GitHub account if one doesn't exist.Pushes to an existing repository if a repository with the same name is found.Effortless Commits: Automatically adds all project files and creates an initial commit.User-Friendly: Provides clear, colored output for each step of the process.üöÄ Getting StartedGetting started is as simple as running the script in your project's root directory.PrerequisitesA terminal or command-line interface.A GitHub account.sudo or administrative privileges may be required for the one-time installation of the GitHub CLI.UsageDownload the Script:Save the script in your project's root directory as push_to_github.sh.Make it Executable:Open your terminal, navigate to your project directory, and run the following command to give the script execution permissions:chmod +x push_to_github.sh
Run the Script:Execute the script from your project's root directory. Do not use sudo../push_to_github.sh
The script will then guide you through the process, asking for your GitHub username, desired repository name, and Git identity if needed.‚öôÔ∏è How It WorksThe script performs the following steps in order:Checks for Git and GitHub CLI (gh): Ensures the necessary tools are available.Authenticates with GitHub: Uses gh auth status to verify your login session.Collects Repository Info: Prompts you for your GitHub username and the new repository's name.Initializes Git: Runs git init if the project is not already a Git repository.Configures Git Identity: Checks git config and prompts for your name and email if they are not set.Commits Files: Stages all files with git add . and creates a commit.Creates & Pushes to GitHub: Uses gh repo create to make a new repository and push your code, or updates the remote and pushes if the repository already exists.ü§ù ContributingContributions are welcome!
