## About

`push_to_github.sh` is a fire-and-forget solution for initializing a project on GitHub, handling everything from dependency checks to the final push. It simplifies the repetitive process of setting up a new repository, making it perfect for developers who want to get their code on GitHub quickly and without manual steps.

## ‚ú® Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Fully Autonomous** | Requires zero manual configuration outside of running the script. |
| **Dependency Checks** | Automatically verifies if git and the GitHub CLI (gh) are installed. |
| **Auto-Installation** | If the GitHub CLI (gh) is not found, it attempts to install it using the system's package manager (supports macOS via Homebrew, and Debian/Ubuntu/Fedora/CentOS on Linux). |
| **Authentication Handling** | Checks if you're logged into GitHub and prompts you to log in if you aren't. |
| **Git Identity Setup** | If your local Git user.name and user.email are not configured, it will ask for them and set them for the current repository. |
| **Smart Repository Handling** | Creates a new public repository on your GitHub account if one doesn't exist, or pushes to an existing repository if a repository with the same name is found. |
| **Effortless Commits** | Automatically adds all project files and creates an initial commit. |
| **User-Friendly** | Provides clear, colored output for each step of the process. |

## üöÄ Getting Started

Getting started is as simple as running the script in your project's root directory.

### Prerequisites

- A terminal or command-line interface.
- A GitHub account.
- `sudo` or administrative privileges may be required for the one-time installation of the GitHub CLI.

### Usage

1. **Download the Script**:
   Save the script in your project's root directory as `push_to_github.sh`.

2. **Make it Executable**:
   Open your terminal, navigate to your project directory, and run the following command to give the script execution permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod +x push_to_github.sh
   ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the script from your project's root directory. Do not use `sudo`.
   ```bash
   ./push_to_github.sh
   ```

The script will then guide you through the process, asking for your GitHub username, desired repository name, and Git identity if needed.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The script performs the following steps in order:

1. **Checks for Git and GitHub CLI (gh)**: Ensures the necessary tools are available.
2. **Authenticates with GitHub**: Uses `gh auth status` to verify your login session.
3. **Collects Repository Info**: Prompts you for your GitHub username and the new repository's name.
4. **Initializes Git**: Runs `git init` if the project is not already a Git repository.
5. **Configures Git Identity**: Checks `git config` and prompts for your name and email if they are not set.
6. **Commits Files**: Stages all files with `git add .` and creates a commit.
7. **Creates & Pushes to GitHub**: Uses `gh repo create` to make a new repository and push your code, or updates the remote and pushes if the repository already exists.
